# Happy Campers Camping App

## Description

AS A USER who enjoys camping in our National Parks <br>
I WANT to have an effective method to search/ view camp grounds by location and amenity <br>
SO THAT I can plan my future camping excursions.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?

## Installation

With our application there is no installation necessary - one can simply launch the app through the deployed heroku link here:  

https://happy-camper12345.herokuapp.com/

When you click on the link above you will be taken to our home page where you can see a list of National Parks and their descriptions.  

Once there you have the ability to create a profile page and login.  Once logged in you can then search for and add National Parks to your Favorite list - you'll be able to use this list to help plan any future camping trips.  If you decide that this park isn't for you, you'll also have the ability to delete the park from your Favorite List.
